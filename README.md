# Renaming Files with Python

In a research project, one needs to maintain good organization skills (which includes uniformity in naming the files), to ensure that you could easily loop through files. 

In this Python code, I rename all the files in multiple folders in a few seconds. My aim is to change the order of the four digits in my file's name. 

Example: from "0602" to "0206". 
         from "3215" to "1532"
